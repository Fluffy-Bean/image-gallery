# OnlyLegs!
Welcome little one, this is the start of something great

Hey Fluffy! Why is this open source when there could still be security issues with all of this?
So people who know what they are doing can help me fix this shit? :'3

# How do I use this!
First of all, I don't recommend anyone using this at this time. Though I want this to get to a state where its usable for anyone to setup and host themselves, its just not anywhere near a state where this is usable. Also, security is just not upto my standards
